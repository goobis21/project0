          From an early age I have always been inspired by the ability to create. Drawing and painting to molding clay and building things, whatever it took to satisfy this need, came first in my life.
          Being a strictly self taught oil painter there were quite a few road blocks along the way but all in all the perserverance of doing something you love will always conquer the learning curves.
          There is certainly still a long way to go and a lot left to learn in the field of art. Becoming a master at such a craft is nothing short of a lifetime commitment.
